Brendan Bickford submission for the fall hackathon

How i got my theme:
The theme I chose to build off of was Jousting. I reached this topic from the SFU wikipedia page through 3 links: i first click on a link to "coat of arms" from the Coat of arms section on the SFU page, them i clicked on a link to "knightly tournament" in the history section of coat of arms, then i clicked on a link to "Jousting" on the jousting section of the tournament page.

Building on my idea:
i decided to build a quick game using p5.js i figured this would be quick and effective for sharing a finished product.

Game mechanics:
the idea of the game is that the player begins each level by jumping over a series of rocks. if the player hits a rock they slow their horse down and loose power. after dodging a few rocks the player must then attack an opposing knight by attacking when the attack gage is closest to the middle. if the attack gage is too far off the player will mis and lose the level. there is a shop for player to purchase upgrades and a training level to help player practice and gain small amounts of gold.

Game Controls:
Spacebar - jump
J - attack
1 - purchase power upgrade
2 - purchase jump upgrade

How to run the game:
the game should be runnable through the following link:
